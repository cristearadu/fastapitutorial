        - data valiation, documentation, serialization
        - easy development
        - few bugs
        - quick & easy to use (designed with a developer in mind + saves time)
        - Robust
        - Standards

Official documentation: https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/
             Rest API for data

pip install "uvicorn[standard]"

CRUD operations
- Create -> POST
- Read -> GET
- Update -> PUT
- Delete -> DELETE

             Request to the server
| Web Page | ----------------->  | SERVER (fastAPI) |
|          | <-----------------  |                  |
            Response from the server

- HTTP request methods

FastAPI would add the asynchronous function behind the scene

@app.get("/api-endpoint") -> specify the endpoint name using this decorator
async def first_api():
    return {"message": "Returned message"}

URL: 127.0.0.1:8000/api-endpoint

Path Parameters = request parameters that have been attached to the URL
    - defined to find information based on location
    - Just like a computer file system
        - /Users/Radu/Coding/Documents/Etc...

URL: 127.0.0.1:8000/books
Read- > GET
@app.get("/books")
async def read_all_books():
    return BOOKS

Path at the end of the URL matches the path of the get
With FastAPI you can make dynamic path parameters!!

URL: 127.0.0.1:8000/books/book_one or book_two etc

@app.get("/books/{dynamic_param}")
async def read_all_books(dynamic_param):
    return {"dynamic_param": dynamic_param}

THE PARAMETER BEWTEEN BRACKETS NEEDS TO MATCH THE PARAMETER INTO THE FUNCTION
ORDER MATTERS WITH TYPE PARAMETERS
If i have a function first with /book/{dynamic_param} and underneath it
we have /books/mybook -> it will automatically call /books/{dynamic_param}
using mybook as the {dynamic_param}
@app.get("/books/{dynamic_param}")
async def read_all_books(dynamic_param):
    return {"dynamic_param": dynamic_param}
@app.get("books/mybook")
async def read_all_books():
    return {"book_title": "My Favorite Book"}

FASTAPI LOOKS INTO CHRONOLOGICAL ORDER FROM TOP TO BOTTOM


in API url you can't have spaces
URL: 127.0.0.1:8000/books/title%20four -> "title four"
space = %20

Query Parameters = parameter to use to sord and filter through thata that is not marked by a path parameter
    - request parameters that have been attached afer a ?
    - name=value pairs
    - filter
    127.0.0.1:8000/books/?category=science
Query parameters can be used with path parameters
    127.0.0.1:8000/books/author%20four/?category=science

    book_author -> PATH PARAMETER
    category -> QUERY PARAMETER
@app.get("/books/{book_author}")
async def read_category_by_query(book_author: str, category: str):
    books_to_return = []
    for book in BOOKS:
        if book.get("author").casefold() == book_author.casefold() and \
                book.get("category").casefold() == category.casefold():
            books_to_return.append(book)

    return books_to_return

POST has a body that has additional info that GET does not have
{"title": "Title Seven", "author": "Author Two", "category": "math"}


127.0.0.1:8000/books/create_book

if Body() is the variable of an argument from a function results this error
The code still compiles
TypeError: Failed to execute 'fetch' on 'Window': Request with GET/HEAD method cannot have body.

PUT used to update data

DELETE
127.0.0.1:8000/books/delete_book/{book_title}


If author is a query parameter -> ERROR: Unprocessable Entity
ORDER MATTERS
@app.get("/books/by_author/")
async def fetch_all_books_by_author(author: str):
{
  "detail": [
    {
      "type": "missing",
      "loc": [
        "query",
        "category"
      ],
      "msg": "Field required",
      "input": null,
      "url": "https://errors.pydantic.dev/2.6/v/missing"
    }
  ]
}



Pydantic v1 vs Pydantic v2
FastAPI is now compatible with both Pydantic v1 and Pydantic v2.
Based on how new the version of FastAPI you are using,
there could be small method name changes.

.dict() -> .model_dump()

async def update_book(updated_book=Body()):
Body -> used to explicitly tell FastAPI to get a value from the request body
and treat is as the parameter value
    -> part of FastAPI dependency injection system
    -When you use Body(), you can also specify additional validation and
     metadata parameters, such as whether a field is required or
     its default value
     -> can use Pydantic models for defining the body's structure and
     validation rules

Pydantics & data validation

Pydantics = python library used for data modelling, data parsing with efficient error handling
    -> create a different request model for data validation
    -> field data validation on each variable/element
    -> helps into convert needed object

from pydantic import BaseModel, Field

class BookRequest(BaseModel):
    # class to see if it maches validations
    # if validation matches -> create Book()
    title: str
    author: str
    description: str
    rating: int
    # For default values
    # title: str = "Title"
    # author: str = "Author"
    # description: str = "Random Description"
    # rating: int = 5
    class Config:
        json_schema_extra = {
            "example": {
                  "title": "Title",
                  "author": "Author",
                  "description": "Random Description",
                  "rating": 4
            }
        }

import Path -> validate path parameters
